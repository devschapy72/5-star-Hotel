      "One of the most common types of room at any hotel is the single. Typically, this means that the room has one bed meant for one person or a couple, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the room is small. In fact, some hotels may offer larger rooms than others, depending on the size of the hotel itself. Guests traveling alone or for business commonly occupy single rooms if they need short-term accommodations and not a lot of extra space",
