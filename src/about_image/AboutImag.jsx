      "As the name suggests, queen rooms offer queen-sized beds that can accommodate two adults comfortably. Some hotels sell queen rooms with two queen beds, so up to four guests can stay in one room. By placing the bed in the center of the wall, the room allows for standard amenities such as a nightstand, a desk or work area, a television, and a closet. Depending on the hotel, this room type may also include a couch or sitting area. Queen room setups in five-star hotels are ideal for couples, families and business partners traveling together.",

    descrption:
      "Both a twin and double room contain two beds in the space, the difference pertaining to the size of the beds and the number of guests that can stay in the room. A twin room contains two single-size beds, so it's meant for a maximum of two guests. A double room, though, can sleep up to four people because it contains two double-size beds. Both contain all the basic accommodations you would expect to find in a hotel room. Twin rooms are often better for those traveling with a friend or business partner, and double rooms are better for families with one or two young children or other groups with three to four traveling together.",
